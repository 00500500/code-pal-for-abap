## Boolean Input Parameter

### What is the Intent of the Check?

This check searches for the usage of boolean input parameters in a method signature since those could be an indicator of bad design where the Single Responsibility Principle is not followed (the method might be doing several things instead of a single thing).   

REMARK: Setter methods using boolean input variables are acceptable.

### How to solve the issue?

Splitting the method may simplify its code and provide a better description for the consumer.

### What to do in case of exception?

You can suppress Code Inspector findings generated by this check using the pseudo comment `"#EC BOOL_PARAM`.  
The pseudo comment has to be placed after the method declaration.

```abap
  METHODS update IMPORTING do_save TYPE abap_bool. "#EC BOOL_PARAM
```

### Example

Before the check:

```abap
  METHODS update IMPORTING do_save TYPE abap_bool.
```

After the check:

```abap
  METHODS update_without_saving.
  METHODS update_and_commit.
```
